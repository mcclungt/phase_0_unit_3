### Reflection
# Ran into many problems along the way with
# this one, but SQL still seems pretty intuitive.
# For some reason the first section doesn't come up as
# finished even though I definitely finished it. Most of
# the quizes I ended up getting one wrong on due to some
# oversight or accident, but I feel as though I'm getting
# the hang of it.
